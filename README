VoxRender is a program that loads 3D voxel models from VOX files and renders them to an SDL graphic window.

----- ARGUMENTS -----

VoxRender can take up to three different arguments: a .vox file to load, as well as the following.

-fullscreen	-	Starts the program in fullscreen mode.
-size=???x???	-	Sets the display resolution.

Ex:
voxrender chair.vox -fullscreen -size=800x600

The above command loads and displays the included "chair.vox" model in a full screen at 800x600.

Note that in Windows, you can simply drag and drop different files onto voxrender.exe to have it load and display them. The default display is 640x480 in a window.

----- CONTROLS -----

The following keystrokes can be used while the program is running:

Arrow keys	-	Move camera forward, backward, left, and right
Page up/down	-	Move camera up/down
Shift		-	Speed key
Space bar		-	Reorient model at camera position
Escape		-	Close program
