VoxRender is a program that loads 3D voxel models from VOX files and renders them to an SDL graphic window.

----- ARGUMENTS -----

VoxRender only takes one argument: the filename of the voxel model to load. Ex:

voxrender chair.vox

The above command loads and displays the included "chair.vox" model.

Note that in Windows, you can simply drag and drop different files onto voxrender.exe to have it load and display them.

----- CONTROLS -----

The following keystrokes can be used while the program is running:

Arrow keys	-	Move camera forward, backward, left, and right
Page up/down	-	Move camera up/down
Shift		-	Speed key
Space bar		-	Reorient model at camera position
Escape		-	Close program

----- KNOWN ISSUES -----

* Fishbowl effect
* Slow performance with some models
* Occasionally visible "cracks"
